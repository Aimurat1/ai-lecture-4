# ThrillZone Adventure Park Customer Service Agent

This project implements an AI-powered customer service system for ThrillZone Adventure Park using an advanced **routing pattern** architecture. The system automatically classifies guest queries and directs them to specialized agents for expert assistance.

## Overview

The ThrillZone Adventure Park Customer Service System uses the routing pattern from [Agent Recipes](https://www.agentrecipes.com/routing) to provide seamless, specialized assistance across all park operations. Instead of a single monolithic agent, the system employs intelligent routing to connect guests with the most appropriate specialist for their needs.

**System**: *Routes to Attraction Expert*

**Attraction Expert**: "Happy birthday to your daughter! I'd be happy to help check if she meets the height requirements for Thunder Mountain Express.

I can also help you reserve Fast Passes for the rides she can enjoy!"

**Guest**: "Great! Can we also get a birthday dinner reservation somewhere special?"

**System**: *Routes to Dining Specialist*
