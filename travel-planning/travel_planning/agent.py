Welcome to the {configs.service_name}!

This system uses advanced parallel processing to provide comprehensive travel planning:
- 5 specialist agents research different aspects of your trip simultaneously
- Real-time web search provides current pricing and availability
- Expert coordination synthesizes all findings into a practical travel plan

Sample travel request: {TravelRequest.get_sample_request().to_json()}

The system efficiently handles complex travel planning through parallel specialist research and intelligent aggregation.
