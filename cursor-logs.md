## 2024-12-19 - External SSE MCP Server Integration

### Action: Integrated FindFlights SSE MCP Server into Transportation Specialist

**Context:** User requested integration of external SSE MCP server (https://findflights.me/sse) into the Google ADK travel planning system. The existing MCP implementation was incorrect - it was wrapping an ADK tool instead of connecting to an external server.

**Problem Identified:**
- Current `MCPToolset` was incorrectly wrapping `google_search` (an ADK tool) instead of connecting to external MCP server
- Missing proper SSE connection parameters
- Incorrect understanding of MCP integration pattern

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Fixed MCP Integration:**
   - Removed incorrect `MCPToolset` that wrapped `google_search`
   - Added proper `SseServerParams` to connect to `https://findflights.me/sse`
   - Imported `SseServerParams` from `google.adk.tools.mcp_tool`

2. **Enhanced Tool Configuration:**
   - Kept `google_search` as separate tool for general transportation research
   - Added external MCP server for specialized flight searches
   - Updated agent instructions to specify when to use each tool

3. **Updated Agent Instructions:**
   - Added guidance on using flight search MCP tools for specific flight queries
   - Maintained Google Search for general transportation research
   - Enhanced research process to include flight analysis step
   - Updated tool usage guidelines

**Technical Changes:**
- **File Modified:** `travel-planning/travel_planning/specialists/transportation_specialist.py`
- **Import Added:** `SseServerParams` from `google.adk.tools.mcp_tool`
- **MCP Configuration:** Proper SSE connection to `https://findflights.me/sse`
- **Tool Strategy:** Dual-tool approach (MCP + Google Search)

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Real-time flight search capabilities via external MCP server
- Complementary tools for comprehensive transportation planning
- Proper MCP implementation following ADK documentation
- Enhanced agent capabilities with specialized flight data

**Architecture Pattern:** External SSE MCP Server integration with Google ADK agents

## 2024-12-19 - README File Creation

### Action: Created comprehensive README.md file for AI Lecture 4 project

**Context:** User requested a README file for the project. After exploring the codebase, identified two main AI agent systems:
1. Customer Service Agent (Routing Pattern) - ThrillZone Adventure Park
2. Travel Planning Agent (Parallel Processing Pattern) - Comprehensive travel planning

**Analysis:**
- Project contains two distinct AI agent implementations using Google ADK
- Customer service system uses routing pattern with 6 specialized agents
- Travel planning system uses parallel processing with 5 concurrent specialists
- Both systems demonstrate advanced multi-agent architectures
- Educational project focused on AI agent design patterns

**Implementation:**
- Created comprehensive README covering both systems
- Included installation and setup instructions
- Added architecture explanations and benefits
- Provided usage examples and demo instructions
- Documented educational value and learning objectives
- Added project structure, configuration, and deployment information

**Key Features Documented:**
- Multi-agent system architectures (Routing vs Parallel)
- Google ADK framework integration
- Real-time web search capabilities
- Performance optimization techniques
- Educational learning outcomes
- Complete setup and usage instructions

**File Created:** `README.md` (comprehensive documentation)

**Technical Details:**
- Python 3.13+ requirements
- Google Cloud Project setup
- Google ADK SDK integration
- Environment configuration
- Demo and testing procedures
