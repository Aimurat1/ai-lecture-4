# Cursor Development Logs

## 2024-12-19 - README File Creation

### Action: Created comprehensive README.md file for AI Lecture 4 project

**Context:** User requested a README file for the project. After exploring the codebase, identified two main AI agent systems:
1. Customer Service Agent (Routing Pattern) - ThrillZone Adventure Park
2. Travel Planning Agent (Parallel Processing Pattern) - Comprehensive travel planning

**Analysis:**
- Project contains two distinct AI agent implementations using Google ADK
- Customer service system uses routing pattern with 6 specialized agents
- Travel planning system uses parallel processing with 5 concurrent specialists
- Both systems demonstrate advanced multi-agent architectures
- Educational project focused on AI agent design patterns

**Implementation:**
- Created comprehensive README covering both systems
- Included installation and setup instructions
- Added architecture explanations and benefits
- Provided usage examples and demo instructions
- Documented educational value and learning objectives
- Added project structure, configuration, and deployment information

**Key Features Documented:**
- Multi-agent system architectures (Routing vs Parallel)
- Google ADK framework integration
- Real-time web search capabilities
- Performance optimization techniques
- Educational learning outcomes
- Complete setup and usage instructions

**File Created:** `README.md` (comprehensive documentation)

**Technical Details:**
- Python 3.13+ requirements
- Google Cloud Project setup
- Google ADK SDK integration
- Environment configuration
- Demo and testing procedures
